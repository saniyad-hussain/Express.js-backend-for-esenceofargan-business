## Running

You need a current version of Node.js installed (currently testing and building with Node v10.8.0 and npm v6.2.0, but latest LTS should be fine).

Run `npm i` (shorthand for `npm install`) to install the dependencies. (This project does not include the package-lock.json, to encourage using the latest versions.)

Run development build and source watcher with `npm run dev`.

You can make a production build of the bundle with `npm run build`.

Run tests with `npm test`. Run tests in watch mode with `npm test -- --watch`.
